# OO-51 Daily Protocol

This repository hosts the OO-51 Daily Protocol, a single-page website detailing a structured daily routine for neurocognitive engineering. The protocol is designed for individuals seeking to enhance mental capabilities through disciplined inner architecture.

## About the Protocol

The OO-51 Daily Protocol is presented as a fixed routine aimed at guiding users from "Scratch to Peak" mental performance. It emphasizes a systematic approach to building, entering, and controlling an inner world. The protocol is divided into four distinct phases:

1.  **Phase I – Grounding & Entry (5 min):** Focuses on intention setting, breath stabilization, and activating a grounding symbol.
2.  **Phase II – World Construction (15 min):** Involves layering sensory details (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory/gustatory), mapping the constructed space, and initiating interaction.
3.  **Phase III – Goal Engagement (10 min):** Users choose a fixed purpose per session (rotated weekly) from options like stress resilience, skill practice, emotional processing, or philosophical inquiry.
4.  **Phase IV – Exit & Reintegration (5 min):** Details the process of dissolving the constructed scene, reaffirming real-world anchors, and immediately recording the session's details.

The protocol also outlines non-negotiable rules, a milestone timeline for progress, and emphasizes the importance of treating the practice as a serious commitment to cognitive engineering rather than a casual exercise.
